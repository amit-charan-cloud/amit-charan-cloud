### Cloud Deployment and Validation Cycle
This process is followed by cloud engineers when deploying, testing, and validating cloud-based applications or environments. The process ensures that the environment is correctly configured, functional, and meets the requirements before moving to production.

1. **Research:**
   - Gather information to ensure best practices are followed using trusted resources. Review official documentation, such as Git repositories, cloud provider guides, or community sources, to gather the correct steps for setting up the environment or application. Identify any prerequisites or dependencies that need to be met before deployment (e.g., operating systems, libraries, or configurations).

2. **Test:**
   - Deploy the cloud infrastructure including cloud instances such as AWS EC2 and install the necessary software stack such as LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP). Configure networking, security settings (firewalls, security groups). Automate the deployment process using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools such as Terraform where applicable.

3. **Validate:**
   - Perform functionality checks of the deployed infrastructure and software for the application. For example, open the website in a browser to check if the web server and database are interacting correctly for database queries and meeting requirements. Verify all configurations such as permissions, correct paths are correct and secure.

4. **Repeat:**
   - Troubleshoot any problems such as misconfigurations, performance bottlenecks, and security vulnerabilities identified in validation. Change or optimize configurations before redeploying the refined environment. Performing load tests or scalability checks before passing it through production.
